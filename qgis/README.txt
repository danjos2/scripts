This is the QGIS installation script


HOW TO USE:
open a terminal
type "sudo curl -LO https://github.com/onthelink-tk/scripts/qgis/QgisStart.sh && sudo bash QgisStart.sh"
Follow the instructions on screen

The password is for anti bot protection:
This is the unique code: Z1UDzOJg2KJU


You can also use our official website to install the script when GitHub is offline for some reason....
Link: https://onthelink.tk/scripts/

The official manual:
https://github.com/onthelink-tk/scripts/blob/master/qgis/qgis%20handleiding.pdf

After the installation make sure you reboot so that you can save projects!!!!




If you want to help us build the script you are allowed to change the script where you think it needs a change! Our script without password protection can be found in the "Help us make it better" folder. (it's a txt file (otherwise bot's could just use that link xD))
