**================================================================================**

In the QGIS script we make use of Flatpak to make the installation quicker and easier to do,

After the installation make sure you reboot so that you can save projects!!!!

**================================================================================**

If you want to help us build the script you are allowed to change the script where you think it needs a change! We also want the script to be available in multiple languages so feel free to translate it in yours, but if you do please tell us in english which language the translation is in and who you are so that we can put your name in the translated script!

If you want to edit the script to make it better then always make sure you do the editing from the folder "Help us make it better". We will only look at the files in that folder and never in the original one. So if you make changes, make them in that specific folder...
