# Scripts
Here you can find all of our scripts we create to make installations easier, we don't create every single thing ourself, we only want to make the installation process super easy and that's why we use other programs in our scripts to achieve this goal

# Before you begin

BEFORE YOU CAN USE THE SCRIPTS AT ALL YOU MUST INSTALL CURL:
`sudo apt-get install curl`

!THE SCRIPTS ARE ALSO STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND MAY SOMETIMES NOT WORK!

!JAVA BELONGS TO ORACLE AND NOT TO US, AND IF THEY WANT OUR SCRIPT TO VANISH FROM THE INTERNET IT **WILL**... ALL COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES OF JAVA BELONG TO ORACLE!

<H4 align="center">
The following section is only for the QGIS-MENU
</H4>

<b><h2 align="center">==================================================</h2></b>

The terminal protection software (TPS) is a minimum protection that only helps if the user doesn't know about the .bashrc file in his home directory of his Chromebook (Please do not install the TPS on a chromebook that you do not own, we are not responsible for anything when and if you do this)


The TPS replaces that .bashrc file with a modified one, this will cause the terminal to close automatically
It does say some stuff before it closes but that's just for fun, ofcourse it isn't updating or checking if the user may or may not use the terminal, but it does exit the terminal (even if users try to cancel the .bashrc file using ctrl_c)

The reason why this protection is so minimal is because QGIS is a free to use program and we just simply cannot give stuff to "granted" users because that would be changing their project and we just simply do not have the rights to do that, so we won't!


How to restore the .bashrc file?
Please follow this tutorial to restore the .bashrc file:

[Restore .bashrc file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onthelink-nl/scripts/master/MUFU/qgis/MUFU/Tutorials/HowToRestoreBashrcFile.txt "Tutorial to restore .bashrc file")


Still want that better "Terminal Lockdown"?
We are working on our new Terminal Lockdown Script (TLS), it will be available in a few months...

Release Date TLS: ??/??/????

# HOW TO USE:

1. Open a terminal
2. Choose the script you want to install and paste the command in the terminal
3. Press "Return" (ENTER)
4. Follow the instructions on your screen
