# Scripts
Here you can find all of our scripts we create to make installations easier, we don't create every single thing ourself, we only want to make the installation process super easy and that's why we use other programs in our scripts to achieve this goal

# Before you begin
THESE SCRIPTS ARE MEANT FOR THE CHROMEBOOKS, IF YOU USE IT ON ANOTHER DEVICE THINGS SHOULD STILL WORK BUT STUFF MAY NOT WORK PROPERLY...

================================================================================
We are not responsible for any damage done to your device by using our scripts!!
================================================================================

The terminal protection software (TPS) is a minimum protection that only helps if the user doesn't know about the .bashrc file in the home directory of their laptop


The TPS replaces that .bashrc file with a modified one, this will cause the terminal to close automatically
It does say some stuff before it closes but that's just for fun, ofcourse it isn't updating or checking if the user may or may not use the terminal, but it does exit the terminal (even if users try to cancel the .bashrc file using ctrl_c)

The reason why this protection is so minimal is because QGIS is a free to use program and we just simply can't give stuff to "granted" users because that would be changing their project and we just simply do not have the rights to do that, so we won't!


How to restore the .bashrc file?
Please follow this tutorial to restore the .bashrc file:
